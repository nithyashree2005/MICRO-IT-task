/* Objectives*/
The goal of this project was to build a simple machine learning model that can understand the emotion or opinion behind a piece of text — like tweets or reviews. The idea was to automatically tell whether the message is positive, negative, or neutral.

This was done using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, all packed into one Python script to keep things clean and easy to follow.

 /*Key Activities*/
Here’s what I did as part of the project:

Loaded a dataset of tweets along with their sentiment labels.

Cleaned up the text by removing things like links, special characters, and converting everything to lowercase.

Preprocessed the data by removing common stopwords (like “the”, “is”, “and”) and converting the text into numbers using TF-IDF (a popular technique in NLP).

Trained a model using Logistic Regression to learn patterns in the data.

Tested the model to see how accurately it could predict sentiment on new text, and printed out a report showing its performance.

/* Technologies Used*/
Python – for the entire workflow

Pandas – to handle and manipulate the dataset

Scikit-learn – to build the machine learning model and evaluate it

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – to clean up and process the text

Regular expressions (re module) – to help with cleaning URLs, symbols, etc.

TF-IDF Vectorizer – to turn text into numerical features the model can learn from
